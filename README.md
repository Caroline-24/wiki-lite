# WikiLite

Original Wikipedia link: https://www.wikipedia.org/
WikiLite is a simplified react-based rebuild of Wikipedia. 

## How to Run WikiLite
1. Clone repository
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

## Components
- Header with title
- Search bar
- Article preview 

## Interactive Features
- Implemented a search feature that filters articles based on user input
- Used React state and “onChange” event to update the displayed articles.
- Added conditional rendering to show a message when no articles match the search.

## Why These Interactions
This search feature supports my goal of making information easier and faster to find. By allowing users to instantly filter articles, it improves navigation clarity and reduces unnecessary scrolling.

## Planned Next Steps
- Add clickable article pages with more detailed content.
- Separate Wikipedia articles and Wikimedia projects into categories.
- Improve styling and layout for a cleaner and better interface.
